# Secure-Image-Steganography-with-Cryptography
This project implements a **secure image steganography** system combined with **AES encryption** to hide and extract messages within images. The **F5 algorithm** is used for efficient steganographic embedding, ensuring minimal visual distortion while maintaining security.
